# LeetCode Problem Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode problem solutions. This repository contains my personal solutions to various problems on LeetCode. The main goal is to document my journey through problem-solving and share my approaches with others who might find them helpful.

## About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate individual currently pursuing my studies at the University of Balamand. My journey in academia has been an exciting blend of challenges and discoveries, particularly in the fascinating world of coding. The thrill of solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life through code is what drives my academic and personal endeavors.

But my interests are not confined to the digital realm. I have a deep appreciation for art in all its forms. This love for art complements my technical skills, allowing me to approach problems with a unique blend of creativity and logic. Whether it's exploring the latest trends in technology or immersing myself in the diverse world of art, I believe in a balanced approach to life, where every moment is an opportunity to learn and grow.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem has its own directory named after the problem.
- Inside each directory, you will find:
  - A `solution` file containing the code (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`).
  - A `README.md` file explaining the problem and the approach used in the solution.

## How to Use This Repository

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the problem directory you are interested in.
- Read the `README.md` for an overview of the problem.
- Review the solution file to understand my approach.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, suggestions and improvements are always welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
